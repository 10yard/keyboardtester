Keyboard Input Test Utility
by 10yard (a.k.a. Degenatrons)

A general purpose keyboard test utility which will echo pressed keys to a virtual on-screen
keyboard.  Currently the utility has UK and US visual keyboards but would support many
different types of keyboard input - including encoders,  such as the KADE encoder.

The keyboard will stay on top of your other sessions and will continue to record keyboard 
input when it is not in focus.

There is a detailed view of activity available by clicking on the "Show Activity Log" 
button.  All inputs are displayed in a list and extensive information about keys is
reported including key code, ASCII code and scan code values. 
To assist those that are setting up encoders for use with MAME and Pinball,  I have
included the default function name that is assigned to the key press.
